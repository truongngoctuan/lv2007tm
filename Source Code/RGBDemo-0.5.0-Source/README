Demo software to visualize, calibrate and process Kinect output
http://nicolas.burrus.name/index.php/Research/KinectRgbDemoV5

This software was partly developed in the RoboticsLab
http://roboticslab.uc3m.es and aims at providing a simple toolkit to
start playing with Kinect data. Features include: * Grab kinect images
and visualize / replay them * Calibrate the camera to get point clouds
in metric space * Export to meshlab/blender using .ply files * Demo of
3D scene reconstruction using a freehand Kinect * Demo of people
detection and localization * Linux, MacOSX and (partial) Windows
support

The code is based on the freenect library http://openkinect.org and
OpenCV http://opencv.willowgarage.com .

The demos are based on a library called nestk. The library itself is
easy to integrate to an existing project using cmake: just copy the
nestk folder as a subfolder of your project and you should be able to
start working with Kinect data. You can get a tutorial to get started
there: http://nicolas.burrus.name/index.php/Research/KinectUseNestk .

ROADMAP
=======

* Multiple Kinect support
* GPU acceleration using OpenCL (partially done)
* New demos!
